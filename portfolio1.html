                <h1><span>Tic Tac Toe</span></h1>
                <p>Tic Tac Toe is a simple, classic game played on a 3x3 grid by two players who take turns marking spaces with their chosen symbol, typically "X" or "O." The objective is to be the first to line up three of one's symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, which results in a win. If all nine squares are filled without any player achieving this alignment, the game ends in a draw. Known for its straightforward rules, Tic Tac Toe encourages strategic thinking as players anticipate and block each other's moves. Often used as an introduction to programming and game development, it's a fun and accessible way to learn about logic and planning.</p>

                <h1><span>Rock Paper Scissor</span></h1>
                <p>Rock Paper Scissors is a simple hand game typically played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand: rock, paper, or scissors. The rules are straightforward: rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round is a tie, and they play again. Often used as a quick decision-making tool or a fun competitive game, Rock Paper Scissors requires no equipment, making it accessible anywhere. It combines chance with a touch of psychology, as players may try to predict and counter their opponentâ€™s choices.</p>
